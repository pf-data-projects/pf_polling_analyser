    <h1>Guide: how to make polling tables with data from Alchemer</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Log in / Sign up</h3>
        <p>The first thing you need to do is sign up for an account if you do not already have one. 
            To do this, click the 'sign up' button in the navbar and fill out the form.</p>
        <p>If you already have an account, then click the 'log in' button in the navbar and enter your username and password. 
            Once you are logged in, the home page will now display the three steps for analysing and formatting your polling data</p>
        <h3>Weighting you survey results</h3>
        <p><strong>Please note that you will need to complete the weighting process in this application 
            regardless of whether you will actually weight the data or not</strong></p>
        <p>From the home page click on the orange button in the panel with the title 'step 1:'.
            In the form that follows, upload your survey data and the standard weight proportions.</p>
        <p>If you want to weight your respondents (e.g. by gender, age, seg, region), you will need to check the checkbox in this form as well.
            However, if you would like to keep your data unweighted (i.e., if you had a small sample of a couple of hundred) 
            then leave the checkbox unchecked.</p>
        <p>Click the button at the bottom of the form to run the weighting. 
            Once that's complete, you'll be redirected to the home page. 
            make sure to download your data using the button on the bottom of the weight panel on this page.</p>
        <p><strong>In the event that your survey is for a different sample than UK NatRep, you can add custom weights.</strong></p>
        <p>First you will need to upload a custom weight proportions file rather than the standard file. 
            Please note that the format will need to be the same as the standard file (i.e. have columns labelled
            group, specific, proportion).</p>
        <p>Second, you'll need to check the box labelled 'Customise your weights?'</p>
        <p>Third, select any of the standard weights that may or may not be included in your custom weights excel file.
            Leave these boxes unchecked if you don't have any of the standard groups in your weights.
        </p>
        <p>Fourth, enter the 'group' value (from the weight proportion file) for each custom weight group as well as the 
            associated question in the data. E.g., if you wanted to weight by those who had children, you might type 'children'
            in the first box, then 'Do you have any children living at home' in the second.</p>
        <h3>Run Calculations for Crossbreaks</h3>
        <p><strong>Please make sure you have run the weighting process before attempting this step</strong></p>
        <p>From the home page, navigate to the middle panel entitled 'step 2:' and click on the button to run calculations.
            You will need to fill out the following form. On the left side of the screen upload your weighted results, 
            survey ID, and the standard crossbreaks you want to include.</p>
        <p>On the right side of the screen you can specify custom crossbreaks for the data. These are optional; you can leave this
            form blank. You can add as many custom crossbreaks as you like, but it may take longer to run the calculations.
        </p>
        <p>Once you're happy, click the upload button. There will be a wait of a few minutes while the application generates 
            your crossbreaks. When it's done it will redirect you to the home page where you can download your data.</p>
        <p>Please make sure to also download the table headers data by clicking the 'download table headers' button 
            in the card under 'Step 2'. You don't need to worry about what this does, but you will need it to create tables.
        </p>
        <h3>Create Polling tables</h3>
        <p>At this point you should have your unformatted polling data showing each crossbreak for each answer.</p>
        <p>To create your polling tables, navigate to the third panel on the home page under 'step 3:'. 
            Click on the button to scan the table. Upload your form and click 'scan table'. 
            Fill out the following form, uploading your table and table header data, adding info regarding dates, title, questions to include, etc.. 
            On the right hand of the screen you can also specify the rebase comment to indicate which respondents certain questions
            were shown.</p>
        <p>When you're satisfied, click the 'run table-maker' button at the bottom of the form. 
            There will be a short wait while your tables are created. As with previous steps you will be redirected 
            to the home page. From here you can also download your polling tables.</p>
        <h3>Running bot checks</h3>
        <p>To access bot checking features of this application, select 'Check for bots' on the main navbar.</p>
        <p>This will take you to a form which allows you to upload raw polling results. You'll need to enter the
            survey ID along with a selection of which style of check you'd like to carry out.
        </p>
        <p>Please be aware that larger datasets will take longer to check than smaller ones.</p>
        <p>Please note that some of these checks make use of the OpenAI API. This is a pay-per-use service that
            allows us to get AI to assess open response answers. Each time we use a check that uses openAI, the PF account is charged some money.
            As such.
        </p>
        <p>PLEASE REFRAIN FROM SUBMITTING MULTIPLE DUPLICATE FORMS IF YOU DON'T NEED TO BECAUSE IT WILL UNNECESSARILY CHARGE THE COMPANY CARD.</p>
